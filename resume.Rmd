intro_text <- "Data and reporting analyst with a background in healthcare logistics, process improvement, and customer-focused operations. I build reliable reporting systems, automate audits, and turn messy operational data into clear insights using Excel and Power BI.

Recent work includes developing service-audit reporting workflows, trend analysis for recurring test order issues, and supporting operational teams with standardized and ad-hoc performance reporting.
